# Virtual Car showroom
The eight project in the MakeYourGame online XR App developper course is to make a VR app where you can see and interact with different cars in a showroom.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can try the app on the oculus quest by downloading the release.


## Blender
The different car models found in CGTrader often have mirrored parts, in order to implement interactions such as opening doors and the trunk I've had to edit them in blender to separate the objects and set their pivot points. Some materials and textures also had to be fixed in blender or modified in unity.
